Creating Symfony Applications

With symfony command:

# run this if you are building a traditional web application
$ symfony new my_project_name --full

# run this if you are building a microservice, console application or API
$ symfony new my_project_name


Or composer command:

# run this if you are building a traditional web application
$ composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton my_project_name
$ composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton:^4.4 my_project_name

# run this if you are building a microservice, console application or API
$ composer create-project symfony/skeleton my_project_name

And Then

$ cd my-project/
$ symfony server:start

or php bin/console server:run
